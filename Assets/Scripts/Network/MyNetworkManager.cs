/*
This is our own network manager that will handle players joining and hosting the game on a server
It inherits the NetworkManager provided by Mirror

When a client connects (Things that will happen client side):
    - Client tries to connect to a server
    - OnStartClient - Always gets called when you start to try and connect to a server
    - OnClientConnect - Only gets called when you actually connect to a server

When a client connects to a server (Things that will happen server side):
    - Server initiates a callback "OnServerConnect" - Saying that a client is tring to connect
    - Once connected theres a small period of time before they are ready to transfer data, and when they're ready
      "OnServerReady" will initiate
    - Then the server will create a player
    - Then another callback will trigger "OnServerAddPlayer" - Telling the server that a player has been added
